-- V2__seed_from_excel.sql
-- This file is a placeholder. The setup script will generate a V2 seed by converting your Excel "Asset Registration" sheet.
-- If you want automatic generation, ensure the Excel is present at repository root and re-run the Excel conversion step separately.
-- For now, DataInitializer will seed basic reference data.
