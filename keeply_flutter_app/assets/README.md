# Assets Directory

This directory contains app assets:

- `images/` - Image assets (logos, icons, etc.)
- `icons/` - Icon files
- `fonts/` - Custom font files (Roboto Regular and Bold)

## Note

The font files referenced in `pubspec.yaml` need to be added:
- `assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf`
- `assets/fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf`

You can download Roboto fonts from Google Fonts or use system fonts by removing the font configuration from `pubspec.yaml`.
